Hello, I'm RedHunterP
There's not much to say about me appart from that I like videogames and modding them, never created a full fledge mod or addon for anygame, appart from texture replacements but I think it's time to learn
I'm currently learning to make AddOns for WoW, I'm in the basics of LUA and VS Studio... wish me luck
Currently this is a personal project and have an aim of what I want to create
You can always reach me through here, I'm doing this for fun, hope my ADHD doesn't ruin it by taking away my focus from it
